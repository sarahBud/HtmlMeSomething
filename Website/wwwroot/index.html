            <p>
                In May 2018 I visited my birthplace Vienna, Austria!
                Here are some of the highlights from my trip!

            <center><footer><article>Austria is often called the "heart" of Europe as it surrounded by a LOT of countries! No fewer than eight countries share their borders with Austria. Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Italy are Austria’s neighbors and their proximity contributes to Austria’s own cultural diversity.</article></footer></center>

            <h2 class="fancy">Day 1 - St Stephens Cathedral</h2>
            <p>
                Exhausted from jetlag we decide to get up and go see the famous St. Stephen's Cathedral. This is a major landmark
                in Vienna, much like St. Louis' arch.
            </p>

            <h2 class="fancy">Day 2 - Schönbrunn Palace</h2>
            <p>
                On day two, we took a bus tour to Schönbrunn Palace. Schönbrunn was built in the early 1700's as a hunting lodge and
                later into a summer residence for nobility.

            <h2 class="fancy">Day 3 - The Prater</h2>
            <p>
                The Prater is a very old amusement park, dating back to 1766. By the late 1800's it was a full fledged fair,
                complete with huge ferris wheel made with old train cars. This was a favorite place for my family to visit when I was
                a baby.

            <h2 class="fancy">Day 4 - Vineyards</h2>
            <p>
                We took a hike to the countryside to see some vineyards. These vineyards had stops along the way where you could
                get a glass of very fresh wine!

            <h2 class="fancy">Day 5 - Day Trip to Budapest</h2>
            <p>
                On day five we took a day trip to Budapest, Hungary. It's a 2 hour drive from Vienna, so not too far! Hungary has a lot
                of history, and delicous food (they're known for their paprika!).

            <h2 class="fancy">Day 6 - Day Trip to Mariazell</h2>
            <p>
                Day six we took a trip out into the country to Mariazell. The cathedral is the most lavish one we've ever seen, lots of
                gold and beautiful paintings. Tourists from all over make a trip to Mariazell just to see the cathedral!
